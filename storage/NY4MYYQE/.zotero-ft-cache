    Abstract: Tremendous progress has been made on face detection in recent years using convolutional neural networks. While many face detectors use designs designated for detecting faces, we treat face detection as a generic object detection task. We implement a face detector based on the YOLOv5 object detector and call it YOLO5Face. We make a few key modifications to the YOLOv5 and optimize it for face detection. These modifications include adding a five-point landmark regression head, using a stem block at the input of the backbone, using smaller-size kernels in the SPP, and adding a P6 output in the PAN block. We design detectors of different model sizes, from an extra-large model to achieve the best performance to a super small model for real-time detection on an embedded or mobile device. Experiment results on the WiderFace dataset show that on VGA images, our face detectors can achieve state-of-the-art performance in almost all the Easy, Medium, and Hard subsets, exceeding the more complex designated face detectors.
