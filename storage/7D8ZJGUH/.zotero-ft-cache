Person Search (PS) has become a major fi eld because of its need in community and in the fi eld of research among
researchers. This task aims to fi nd a probe person from whole scene which shows great signi fi cance in video sur-
veillance fi eld to track lost people, re-identi fi cation, and veri fi cation of person. In last few years, deep learning has
played unremarkable role for the solution of re-identi fi cation problem. Deep learning shows incredible perfor-
mance in person (re-ID) and search. Researchers experience more fl exibility in proposing new methods and
solve challenging issues such as low resolution, pose variation, background clutter, occlusion, viewpoints, and
low illumination. Specially, convolutional neural network (CNN) achieves breakthrough performance and ex-
tracts useful patterns and characteristics. Development of new framework takes substantial efforts; hard work
and computation cost are required to acquire excellent results. This survey paper includes brief discussion
about feature representation learning and deep metric learning with novel loss functions. We thoroughly review
datasets with performance analysis on existing datasets. Finally, we are reviewing current solutions for further
consideration.

1. Introduction
As an essential and demanding problem in computer vision, person
re-ID [1,2] and person search [3] have emerged an independent topic
and fast-growing topic in computer vision that deals with person re-
trieval in videos and digital images. Deep learning has become a major
technique for researchers; the victory of deep learning methods has
conducted new wave into person re-identi fi cation, moving towards to
a research highlight. Person (re-ID) has been broadly used in academic
community and large-scale industry implementation, such as public
safety, tracking of person in widespread public parks, universities and
streets, behavior analysis and surveillance. From the perspective of
video surveillance community, the energizing and most critical issue
of person search is to correctly match a probe person that has been ob-
served in cameras at different locations under heavy intensive changes
in pose, viewpoints and lighting has more signi fi cance importance in re-
search community.
There are mostly two major techniques of person retrieval. One
method is to match an investigated person with the gallery of manually
cropped persons which is little far from real-world applications (see
Fig. 1). While person search is an advanced and exacting task which
seeks to identify person from whole scene of images which is closer to
real world implementation. Another technique is person search (PS) de-
tects all persons and recognize the probe person in an image exclusive
of proposal and bounding box that is divergent from person re-ID (see
Fig. 2). Nevertheless, person search is near to physical world and quite
demanding but as automated pedestrian's detection makes incorrect
detection and unbalanced images. That's why: solving complex prob-
lems of person re-ID and person search are extremely hard job due to
human posture, light, video camera position, low resolution, occlusion,
viewpoints, pose estimation and different variations in images [5 – 10].
Biometric signs like face and walking style are impossible to detect
and track a person in low resolution of cameras [11,12]. The re-
identi fi cation and person search task only rely on visual appearance
[13,17]. Although several detectors achieve well on lighting and occlu-
sion free situation, some of them produce imperfectly on the task of de-
tecting person. This is because of above aforementioned issues in person
search. Moreover, the knowledge of person search is very little because
previous accomplishment is focused on person (re-ID) problems. (See
Fig. 3.)
This paper proposes an extensive and in-depth review on person
search. Our survey objective is to make comprehensively six parts of
person search methods, including feature learning, architectural design,
deep metric learning, and loss function design. Apart from taxonomi-
cally discussing the previous person search techniques, we extensively
explore previous datasets of person search. We comprehensively exam-
ine the performance of person search techniques and present ongoing
promising directions for future work.

1.1. Background and scope
The history of person search is comparatively little. Recent work on
person search is mainly about person retrieval using hand-crafted fea-
tures and deep learning techniques in images [4,11]. Before the wide-
spread of deep learning, commonness in shape and human body
appearance-based features are utilized [11]. Upon the rapid progression
of CNN, various deep learning-based person search approaches have
emerged. However, mostly surveys and researches emphasizing hardly
on person (re-ID). In order to take fi rst step, Yuanlu et al. [11] put for-
ward the fi rst step to introduce the person search uniqueness, a Gauss-
ian Generative Model (GMM) to catch commonness between persons,
and provide a baseline result in order to investigate and explore more
about person (re-ID). Later, Tong et al. [4] proposed and suggested an ef-
fective person search technique which cooperatively handles person
detection and (re-ID) in same convolutional neural network.
Completely different from the GMM and Fisher vector used in [11],
Jinfu Yang et al. [31] use hand crafted features [14] for pedestrian detec-
tion and retrieval in images. SSD [72] and faster r-cnn [65] are two
major detectors in pedestrian detection. Some pedestrian detection ap-
proaches [4,40,54 – 56,59] utilize Faster R-CNN, some researchers modify
[65] and proposed more accurate pedestrian detector [62]. Further-
more, feature learning [20,22,31], multi-scale feature learning [3,30,
56], architecture designs [4,31], loss functions [54 – 62], major contribu-
tion [21,22] and convolutional neural networks [48,49] are also utilized
for person search. A brief timeline illustrated in Fig. 4.
We have precisely and thoroughly selected remarkable and distin-
guished papers published in outstanding journals and top venue confer-
ences. This survey focuses on the rapid advancement in person search in
last four to six years. In addition to this, some other correlated work is
also comprised to make our work more understanding and helpful in
this fi eld. We restrict this survey paper only for person search tech-
niques and little discussion about recent work in person (re-ID). Other
than that, some work related to person (re-ID), such as re-
identi fi cation in two separate steps will also be included in our
discussion.
1.2. Comparison with previous surveys
Several remarkable person (re-ID) surveys have been published. The
particular comprise numerous reviews on the person retrieval under
certain conditions, such as heterogeneous person (re-ID) [73,78],
open-world and closed-world settings [15,74], hand-crafted features
and deep learning techniques for image and video-based [74], tradi-
tional approaches [76], and gait based person (re-ID) [7,77]. In addition
to these subject speci fi c person (re-ID) surveys and reviews, numerous
numbers of general person (re-ID) surveys [1,10,15,16,75,79]. Among
these, Srikrishnaet al. [1] extensively evaluate performance of single
and multi-shot (re-ID) with metric learning, including feature extrac-
tion, ranking techniques, evaluate methods on new large-scale dataset
and 16 publicly available datasets. Bahramet al. [75] gives comprehen-
sive survey on person (re-ID) using deep neural networks: he men-
tioned some guidelines and limitations. Moreover, Mohammad et al.
[79] brie fl y discussed many aspects of person (re-ID), covering intra/
inter camera, spatial features, textual and appearance descriptors, and
datasets. Similarly, Di et al. [80] thoroughly reviewed many deep
models, including identi fi cation, veri fi cation, deep metric learning,
video-based and data augmentation based deep models. Furthermore,
he broadly reviewed previous person (re-ID) in several years, datasets
and discussed future insights. From the viewpoint of person search
(re-ID), these surveys do not discuss and focus on person search. We
are introducing a systematic and complete review of deep learning algo-
rithms that mutually handle person detection and re-ID. This survey is
focused by critical and in-depth analysis of person search. We sum up
existing person search algorithms based on six different angles: feature
