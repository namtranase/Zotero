    Abstract: In this report, we present PP-YOLOE, an industrial state-of-the-art object detector with high performance and friendly deployment. We optimize on the basis of the previous PP-YOLOv2, using anchor-free paradigm, more powerful backbone and neck equipped with CSPRepResStage, ET-head and dynamic label assignment algorithm TAL. We provide s/m/l/x models for different practice scenarios. As a result, PP-YOLOE-l achieves 51.4 mAP on COCO test-dev and 78.1 FPS on Tesla V100, yielding a remarkable improvement of (+1.9 AP, +13.35% speed up) and (+1.3 AP, +24.96% speed up), compared to the previous state-of-the-art industrial models PP-YOLOv2 and YOLOX respectively. Further, PP-YOLOE inference speed achieves 149.2 FPS with TensorRT and FP16-precision. We also conduct extensive experiments to verify the effectiveness of our designs.
