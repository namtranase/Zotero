Abstract
Gait, the walking pattern of individuals, is one of the most important biometrics modalities. Most of the existing gait recognition methods take silhouettes or articulated body models as the gait features. These methods suffer from degraded recognition performance when handling confounding variables, such as clothing, carrying and view angle. To remedy this issue, we propose a novel AutoEncoder framework to explicitly disentangle pose and appearance features from RGB imagery and the LSTM-based integration of pose features over time produces the gait feature. In addition, we collect a Frontal-View Gait (FVG) dataset to focus on gait recognition from frontal-view walking, which is a challenging problem since it contains minimal gait cues compared to other views. FVG also includes other important variations, e.g., walking speed, carrying, and clothing. With extensive experiments on CASIA-B, USF and FVG datasets, our method demonstrates superior performance to the state of the arts quantitatively, the ability of feature disentanglement qualitatively, and promising computational efﬁciency.

Figure 1: We propose a novel CNN-based model, termed GaitNet, to automatically learn the disentangled gait feature from a walking video, as opposed to handcrafted GEI, or skeleton-based features. While many conventional gait databases study side-view imagery, we collect a new gait database where both gallery and probe are captured in frontal-views.

1. Introduction
Biometrics measures people’s unique physical and behavioral characteristics to recognize the identity of an individual. Gait [35], the walking pattern of an individual, is one of the biometrics modalities, e.g., face, ﬁngerprint, and iris. Gait recognition has the advantage that it can operate at a distance without user cooperation. Also, it is difﬁcult to camouﬂage. Due to these advantages, gait recognition is applicable to many applications such as person identiﬁcation, criminal investigation, and healthcare.
As other recognition problems in vision, the core of gait recognition lies in extracting gait-related features from the video frames of a walking person, where the prior approaches are categorized into two types: appearance-based and model-

based methods. The appearance-based methods such as Gait Energy Image (GEI) [20] take the averaged silhouette image as the gait feature. While having a low computational cost and can handle low-resolution imagery, it can be sensitive to variations such as clothes change, carrying, view angles and walking speed [37, 5, 46, 6, 24, 1]. The model-based method ﬁrst performs pose estimation and takes articulated body skeleton as the gait feature. It shows more robustness to those variations but at a price of a higher computational cost and dependency on pose estimation accuracy [17, 2].
It is understandable that the challenge in designing a gait feature is the necessity of being invariant to the appearance variation due to clothing, viewing angle, carrying, etc. Therefore, our desire is to disentangle the gait feature from the visual appearance of the walking person. For both

appearance-based or model-based methods, such disentanglement is achieved by manually handcrafting the GEI or body skeleton, since neither has color information. However, we argue that these manual disentanglements may lose certain or create redundant gait information. E.g., GEI learns the average contours over time, but not the dynamic of how body parts move. For body skeleton, under carrying condition, certain body joints such as hands may have ﬁxed positions, and hence are redundant information to gait.
To remedy the issues in handcrafted features, as shown in Fig. 1, this paper aims to automatically disentangle the pose/gait features from appearance features, and use the former for gait recognition. This disentanglement is realized by designing an autoencoder-based CNN, GaitNet, with novel loss functions. For each video frame, the encoder estimates two latent representations, pose feature (i.e., framebased gait feature) and appearance feature, by employing two loss functions: 1) cross reconstruction loss enforces that the appearance feature of one frame, fused with the pose feature of another frame, can be decoded to the latter frame; 2) gait similarity loss forces a sequence of pose features extracted from a video sequence, of the same subject to be similar even under different conditions. Finally, the pose features of a sequence are fed into a multi-layer LSTM with our designed incremental identity loss to generate the sequence-based gait feature, where two of which can use the cosine distance as the video-to-video similarity metric.
Furthermore, most prior work [20, 46, 33, 12, 2, 7, 13] often choose the walking video of the side view, which has the richest gait information, as the gallery sequence. However, practically other view angles, such as the frontal view, can be very common when pedestrians toward or away from the surveillance camera. Also, the prior work [40, 10, 11, 34] that focuses on frontal view are often based on RGB-D videos, which have richer depth information than RGB videos. Therefore, to encourage gait recognition from the frontal-view RGB videos that generally has the minimal amount of gait information, we collect a high-deﬁnition (HD,1080p) frontal-view gait database with a wide range of variations. It has three frontal-view angles where the subject walks from left 45◦, 0◦, and right 45◦ off the optical axes of the camera. For each of three angles, different variants are explicitly captured including walking speed, clothing, carrying, clutter background, etc.
The contributions of this work are the following: 1) We propose an autoencoder-based network, GaitNet,

with novel loss functions to explicitly disentangle the pose features from visual appearance and use multi-layer LSTM to obtain aggregated gait feature.
2) We introduce a frontal-view gait database, named FVG, including various variations of viewing angles, walking speeds, carrying, clothing changes, background and time gaps. This is the ﬁrst HD gait database, with a nearly doubled number of subjects than prior RGB gait databases.
3) Our proposed method outperforms state of the arts on three benchmarks, CASIA-B, USF, and FVG datasets.
2. Related Work
Gait Representation. Most prior works are based on two types of gait representations. In appearance-based methods, gait energy image (GEI) [20] or gait entropy image (GEnI) [5] are deﬁned by extracting silhouette masks. Specifically, GEI uses an averaged silhouette image as the gait representation for a video. These methods are popular in the gait recognition community for their simplicity and effectiveness. However, they often suffer from sizeable intra-subject appearance changes due to covariates such as clothing, carrying, views, and walking speed. On the other hand, modelbased methods [17] ﬁt articulated body models to images and extract kinematic features such as 2D body joints. While they are robust to some covariates such as clothing and speed, they require a relatively higher image resolution for reliable pose estimation and higher computational costs.
In contrast, our approach learns gait information from raw RGB video frames which contain the richer information, thus with higher potential of extracting discriminative gait features. The most relevant work to ours is [12], which learns gait features from RGB images via Conditional Random Field. Compared to [12], our CNN-based approach has the advantage of being able to leverage a large amount of training data and learning more discriminative representation from data with multiple covariates. This is demonstrated by our extensive comparison with [12] in Sec. 5.2.1. Gait Databases. There are many classic gait databases such as SOTON Large dataset [39], USF [37], CASIA-B [23], OU-ISIR [32], TUM GAID [23] and etc. We compare our FVG database with the most widely used ones in Tab. 1. CASIA-B is a large multi-view gait database with three variations: view angle, clothing, and carrying. Each subject is captured from 11 views under three conditions: normal walking (NM), walking in coats (CL) and walking while carrying bags (BG). For each view, 6, 2 and 2 videos are recorded

Figure 2: Overall architecture of our proposed approach, with three novel loss functions.

from normal, coats and bags conditions. USF database has 122 subjects with ﬁve variations, totaling 32 conditions for each subject. It contains two view angles (left and right), two ground surface (grass and concrete), shoes change, carrying condition and time. While OU-ISIR-LP and OU-ISIR-LPBag are large datasets, we can not leverage them as only the silhouette is publicly released.
Unlike those databases, our FVG database focuses on the frontal view, with 3 different near frontal-view angles towards the camera, and other variations including walking speed, carrying, clothing, cluttered background and time.
Disentanglement Learning. Besides model-based approaches [43, 42, 31] representing data with semantic latent vectors; data-driven disentangled representation learning approaches are gaining popularity in computer vision community. DrNet [14] disentangles content and pose vectors with a two-encoders architecture, which removes content information in the pose vector by generative adversarial training. The work of [3] segments foreground masks of body parts by 2D pose joints via U-Net [36] and then transforms body parts to desired motion with adversarial training. Similarly, [15] utilizes U-net and Variational Auto Encoder (VAE) to disentangle an image into appearance and shape. DR-GAN [44, 45] achieves state-of-the-art performances on pose-invariant face recognition by explicitly disentangling pose variation with a multi-task GAN [19].
Different from [14, 3, 15], our method has only one encoder to disentangle the appearance and gait information, through the design of novel loss functions without the need for adversarial training. Unlike DR-GAN [45], our method does not require adversarial training, which makes training more accessible. Further, pose labels are used in DR-GAN training so as to disentangle identity feature from the pose. However, to disentangle gait and appearance feature from the RGB information, there is no gait nor appearance label to

be utilized for our method, since the type of walking pattern or clothes cannot be deﬁned as discrete classes.
3. Proposed Approach
Let us start with a simple example. Assuming there are three videos, where videos 1 and 2 capture subject A wearing t-shirt and long down coat respectively, and in video 3 subject B wears the same long down coat as in video 2. The objective is to design an algorithm, from which the gait features of video 1 and 2 are the same, while those of video 2 and 3 are different. Clearly, this is a challenging objective, as the long down coat can easily dominate the feature extraction, which would make videos 2 and 3 to be more similar than videos 1 and 2 in the latent space of gait features. Indeed the core challenge, as well as the objective, of gait recognition is to extract gait features that are discriminative among subjects, but invariant to different confounding factors, such as viewing angles, walking speeds and appearance.
Our approach to achieve this objective is via feature disentanglement - separating the gait feature from appearance information for a given walking video. As shown in Fig. 2, the input to our model is a video frame, with background removed using any off-the-shelf pedestrian detection and segmentation method [21, 9, 8]. An encoder-decoder network, with carefully designed loss functions, is used to disentangle the appearance and pose features for each video frame. Then, a multi-layer LSTM explores the temporal dynamics of pose features and aggregates them to a sequence-based gait feature for the identiﬁcation purpose. In this section, we ﬁrst present the feature disentanglement, followed by temporal aggregation, and ﬁnally implementation details.
3.1. Appearance and Pose Feature Disentanglement
For the majority of gait recognition datasets, there is a limited appearance variation within each subject. Hence, appearance could be a discriminate cue for identiﬁcation

during training as many subjects can be easily distinguished by their clothes. Unfortunately, any networks or feature extractors relying on appearance will not generalize well on the test set or in practice, due to potentially diverse clothing or appearance between two videos of the same subject.
This limitation on training sets also prevents us from learning good feature extractors if solely relying on identiﬁcation objective. Hence we propose to learn to disentangle the gait feature from the visual appearance in an unsupervised manner. Since a video is composed of frames, disentanglement should be conducted on the frame level ﬁrst. Because there is no dynamic information within a video frame, we aim to disentangle the pose feature from the visual appearance for a frame. The dynamics of pose features over a sequence will contribute to the gait feature. In other words, we view the pose feature as the manifestation of video-based gait feature at a speciﬁc frame.
To this end, we propose to use an encoder-decoder network architecture with carefully designed loss functions to disentangle the pose feature from appearance feature. The encoder, E, encodes a feature representation of each frame, I, and explicitly splits it into two parts, namely appearance fa and pose fg features:

fa, fg = E(I).

(1)

These two features are expected to fully describe the original input image. As they can be decoded back to the original input through a decoder D:

I = D(fa, fg).

(2)

We now deﬁne the various loss functions deﬁned for learning the encoder, E, and decoder D.
Cross Reconstruction Loss. The reconstructed I should be close to the original input I. However, enforcing selfreconstruction loss as in typical auto-encoder can’t ensure the appearance fa learning appearance information across the video and fg representing pose information in each frame. Hence we propose the cross reconstruction loss, using an appearance feature fat1 of one frame and pose feature fgt2 of another one to reconstruct the latter frame:

Lxrecon =

D(fat1 , fgt2 ) − It2

2,
2

(3)

where It is the video frame at the time step t. The cross reconstruction loss, on one hand, can play a
role as the self-reconstruction loss to make sure the two features are sufﬁciently representative to reconstruct video frames. On the other hand, as we can pair a pose feature of a current frame to the appearance feature of any frame in the same video to reconstruct the same target, it enforces the appearance features to be similar across all frames.
Gait Similarity Loss. The cross reconstruction loss prevents the appearance feature fa to be over-represented, con-

taining pose variation that changes between frames. However, appearance information may still be leaked into pose feature fg. In an extreme case, fa is a constant vector while fg encodes all the information of a video frame. To make fg “cleaner”, we leverage multiple videos of the same subject. Extra videos can introduce the change in appearance. Given two videos of the same subject with length n1, n2 in two different conditions c1, c2. Ideally, c1, c2 should contain difference in the person’s appearance, i.e., cloth changes. While appearance changes, the gait information should be consistent between two videos. Since it’s almost impossible to enforce similarity on fg between video frames as it requires precise frame-level alignment; we enforce the similarity between two videos’ averaged pose features:

Lgait-sim =

1 n1

fg(t,c1) −
t=1

3.2. Gait Feature Learning via Aggregation
Even when we can disentangle appearance and pose information for each video frame, the current feature fg only contains the walking pose of the person in a speciﬁc instance, which can share similarity with another speciﬁc instance of a very different person. Here, we are looking for discriminative characteristics in a person walking pattern. Therefore, modeling its temporal change is critical. This is where temporal modeling architectures like the recurrent neural network or long short-term memory (LSTM) work best.
Speciﬁcally, in this work, we utilize a multi-layer LSTM structure to explore spatial (e.g., the shape of a person) and mainly, temporal (e.g., how the trajectory of subjects’ body parts changes over time) information on pose features. As shown in Fig. 2, pose features extracted from one video sequence are feed into a 3-layer LSTM. The output of the LSTM is connected to a classiﬁer C, in this case, a linear classiﬁer is used, to classify the subject’s identity.
Let ht be the output of the LSTM at time step t, which is accumulative after feeding t pose features fg into it:

ht = LSTM(fg1, fg2, ..., fgt).

(5)

Now we deﬁne the loss function for LSTM. A trivial option for identiﬁcation is to add the classiﬁcation loss on top of the LSTM output of the ﬁnal time step:

Lid-single = − log(Ck(hn)),

(6)

which is the negative log likelihood that the classiﬁer C correctly identiﬁes the ﬁnal output hn as its identity label k.
Identiﬁcation with Averaged Feature. By the nature of LSTM, the output ht is greatly affected by its last input fgt. Hence the LSTM output, ht, can be varied across time steps. With a desire to obtain a gait feature that can be robust to the

stopping instance of a walking cycle, we propose to use the averaged LSTM output as our gait feature for identiﬁcation:

fgtait

1 t

(7)

s=1

The identiﬁcation loss can be rewritten as:

Lid-avg = − log(Ck(fgnait))

= − log

Ck

.

(8)

s=1

Incremental Identity Loss. LSTM is expected to learn that the longer the video sequence, the more walking information it processes then the more conﬁdent it identiﬁes the subject. Instead of minimizing the loss on the ﬁnal time step, we propose to use all the intermediate outputs of every time step weighted by wt:

1n

Lid-inc-avg = n

−wt log

Ck

1 t hs t

t=1

s=1

. (9)

To this end, the overall training loss function is:

L = Lid-inc-avg + λrLxrecon + λsLgait-sim.

(10)

The entire system, encoder-decoder, and LSTM are jointly trained. Updating E to optimize Lid-inc-avg also helps to further generate pose feature that has identity information and on which LSTM is able to explore temporal dynamics. At the test time, the output fgtait of LSTM is the gait feature of the video and used as the identity feature representation for matching. The cosine similarity score is used as the metric.
3.3. Implementation Details
Segmentation and Detection. Our network receives video frames with the person of interest segmented. The foreground mask is obtained from the state-of-the-art instance segmentation, Mask R-CNN [21]. Instead of using a zeroone mask by hard thresholding, we keep the soft mask returned by the network, where each pixel indicates the probability of being a person. This is partially due to the difﬁculty in choosing a threshold. Also, it prevents the loss in information due to the mask estimation error. We use a bounding box with a ﬁxed ratio of width : height = 1 : 2 with the absolute height and center location given by the Mask R-CNN network. Input is obtained by pixel-wise multiplication between the mask and RGB values which is then resized to 32 × 64.
Network hyperparameter. Our encoder-decoder network is a typical CNN. Encoder consisting of 4 stride-2 convolution layers following by Batch Normalization and Leaky ReLU activation. The decoder structure is an inverse of the encoder, built from transposed convolution, Batch Normalization and Leaky ReLU layers. The ﬁnal layer has a

Sigmoid activation to bring the value into [0, 1] range as the input. The classiﬁcation part is a stacked 3-layer LSTM [18], which has 256 hidden units in each of cells.
Adam optimizer [27] is used with the learning rate of 0.0001, and the momentum of 0.9. For each batch, we use video frames from 32 different clips. Since video lengths are varied, a random crop of 20-frame sequence is applied; all shorter videos are discarded. For Eqn. 9, we set wt = t2 while other options such as wt = 1 also yield similar performance. The λr and λs (Eqn. 10) are set to 0.1 and 0.005 in all experiments.
4. Front-View Gait Database
Collection. To facilitate the research of gait recognition from frontal-view angles, we collect the Front-View Gait (FVG) database in a course of two years 2017 and 2018. During the capturing, we place the camera (Logitech C920 Pro Webcam or GoPro Hero 5) on a tripod at the height of 1.5 meter. We ask each of 226 subjects to walk toward the camera 12 times starting from around 16 meters, which results in 12 videos per subject. The videos are captured at 1, 080 × 1, 920 resolution with the average length of 10 seconds. The height of human in the video ranges from 101 to 909 pixels. These 12 walks have the combination of three angles toward the camera (−45◦, 0◦, 45◦ off the optical axes of the camera), and four variations.
FVG is collected in three sessions. In session 1, in 2017, videos from 147 subjects are collected with four variations (normal walking, slow walking, fast walking, and carrying status). In session 2, in 2018, videos from additional 79 subjects are collected. Variations are normal, slow or fast walking speed, clothes or shoes change, and twilight or clus-

tered background. Finally in session 3, we collect repeated 12 subjects in year 2018 for extreme challenging test with the same setup as section 1. The purpose is to test how time gaps affect gait, along with changes in cloth/shoes or walking speed. Fig. 3 shows exemplar images from FVG. Protocols. Different from prior gait databases, subjects in FVG are walking toward the camera, which creates a great challenge on exploiting gait information as the difference in consecutive frames can be much smaller than side-view walking. We focus our evaluation on variations that are challenging, e.g., different appearance, carrying a bag, or are not presented in other databases, e.g., cluttered background, along with view angles.
To benchmark research on FVG, we deﬁne 5 evaluation protocols, among which there are two commonalities: 1) the ﬁrst 136 and rest 90 subjects are used for training and testing respectively; 2) the video 2, the normal frontal-view walking, is used as the gallery. The 5 protocols differ in their speciﬁc probe data, which cover the variations of Walking Speed (WS), Carrying Bag (CB), Changing Clothes (CL), Cluttered Background (CBG), and all variations (All). At the top part of Fig. 6, we list the detailed probe set for all 5 protocols. E.g., for the WS protocol, the probes are video 4 − 9 in session 1 and video 4 − 6 in session 2.
5. Experiments
Databases. We evaluate the proposed approach on three gait databases, CASIA-B [47], USF [37] and FVG. As mentioned in Sec. 2, CASIA-B, and USF are the most widely used gait databases, making the comparison with prior work easier. We compare our method with [46, 12, 29, 30] on these two databases, by following the respective experimental protocols of the baselines. These are either the most recent

For each example, fa is extracted from the most left column image (CL) and fg is extracted from the top row images (NM). Top row synthesized images are generated with model trained without Lgait-sim loss, bottom row is with the loss. To show the differences, details in generated images are magniﬁed.

and state-of-the-art work or classic gait recognition methods. The OU-ISIR database [32] is not evaluated, and related methods [33] are not compared since our work consumes RGB video input, but OU-ISIR only releases silhouettes.
5.1. Ablation Study
Feature Visualization. To aid on understanding our features, we randomly pair fa, fg features from different images and visualize the resultant paired feature by feeding it into our learned decoder D. As shown in Fig. 4, each result is generated by paring the appearance fa in the ﬁrst column, and the pose fg in the ﬁrst row. The synthesized images show that indeed fa contributes all the appearance information, e.g., cloth, color, texture, contour, as they are consistent across each row. Meanwhile, fg contributes all the pose information, e.g., position of hand and feet, which share similarity across columns. We also visualize features fa, fg individually by forcing the other feature to be a zero vector 0. Without fg, the reconstructed image still shares appearance similarity with fa input but does not show a clear walking pose. Meanwhile, when removing fa, the reconstructed image still mimics the pose of fg’s input. Disentanglement with Gait Similarity Loss. With the cross reconstruction loss, the appearance feature fa can be

enforced to represent static information that shares across the video. However, as discussed, the feature fg can be spoiled or even encode the whole video frame. Here we show the need for the gait similarity loss Lgait-sim on the feature disentanglement. Fig. 5 shows the cross visualization of two different models learned with and without Lgait-sim. Without Lgait-sim the decoded image shares some appearance characteristic, e.g., cloth style, contour, with fg. Meanwhile with Lgait-sim, appearance better matches with fa.
Joints Location as Pose Feature. In literature, there is a large amount of effort in human pose estimation [17]. Aggregating joint locations over time could be a good candidate for gait features. Here we compare our framework with a baseline, named PE-LSTM, using pose estimation results as the input to the same LSTM as ours. Using state-of-the-art pose estimator [16], we extract 14 joints’ locations and feed to the LSTM. This network achieves the recognition accuracy of 65.4% TDR at 1% FAR on the ALL protocol of FVG dataset, where our method outperforms it with 81.2%. This result demonstrates that our pose feature fg does explore more discriminate feature than the joints’ locations alone.
Loss Function’s Impact on Performance. As the system consists of multiple loss functions, here we analyze the effect of each loss function on the ﬁnal recognition performance. Tab. 2 reports the recognition accuracy of different variants of our framework on CASIA-B dataset under NM and CL. We ﬁrst explore the effects of different disentanglement losses. Using Lid-inc-avg as the classiﬁcation loss, we train different variants of our framework: a baseline without any disentanglement losses, a model with Lxrecon, and

our full model with both Lxrecon and Lgait-sim. The baseline achieves the accuracy of 56.0%. Adding the Lxrecon slightly improves the performance to 60.2%. By combining with Lgait-sim, our model signiﬁcantly improves the performance to 85.6%. Between Lxrecon and Lgait-sim, the gait similarity loss plays a more critical role as Lxrecon is mainly designed to constrain the appearance feature fa, which does not directly involve identiﬁcation.
Using the combination, Lxrecon and Lgait-sim, we benchmark different options for classiﬁcation loss as presented in Sec. 3.1, as well as the autoencoder loss by Srivastava et al. [41]. The model using the conventional identity loss on the ﬁnal LSTM output Lid-single achieves the rank-1 accuracy of 26.0%. Using the average output of LSTM as identity feature, Lid-average, shows to improve the performance to 62.6%. The autoencoder loss [41] achieves a good performance, 71.2%. However, it is still far from our proposed incremental identity loss Lid-inc-avg’s performance.
5.2. Evaluation on Benchmark Datasets
5.2.1 CASIA-B
Since various experimental protocols have been deﬁned on CASIA-B, for a fair comparison, we strictly follow the respective protocols in the baseline methods. Following [46], Protocol 1 uses the ﬁrst 74 subjects for training and rest 50 for testing, regarding variations of NM (normal), BG (carrying bag) and CL (wearing a coat) with crossing view angles of 0◦, 54◦, 90◦, and 126◦. Three models are trained for comparison in Tab. 4. For the detailed protocol, please refer to [46]. Here we mainly compare our performance to Wu et al. [46], along with other methods [26]. Under multiple view angles and cross three variations, our method (GaitNet) achieves the best performance on all comparisons.
Recently, Chen et al. [12] propose new protocols to unify the training and testing where only one single model is being trained for each protocol. Protocol 2 focuses on walking direction variations, where all videos used are in NM. The training set includes videos of ﬁrst 24 subjects in all view angles. The rest 100 subjects are for testing. The gallery is made of four videos at 90◦ view for each subject. Videos from remaining view angles are the probe. The rank 1 recognition accuracy are reported in Tab. 3. Our GaitNet achieves the best average accuracy of 81.8% across ten view angles, with signiﬁcant improvement on extreme views. E.g., at

view angles of 0◦, and 180◦, the improvement margins are 30% and 26% respectively. This shows that GaitNet learns a better view-invariant gait feature than other methods.
Protocol 3 focuses on appearance variations. Training sets have videos under BG and CL. There are 34 subjects in total with 54◦ to 144◦ view angles. Different test sets are made with the different combination of view angles of the gallery and probe as well as the appearance condition (BG or CL). The results are presented in Tab. 5. We have comparable performance with the state-of-the-art method L-CRF [12] on BG subset while signiﬁcantly improving the performance on CL subset. Note that due to the challenge of CL protocol, there is a signiﬁcant performance gap between BG and CL for all methods except ours, which is yet another evidence that our gait feature has strong invariance to all major gait variations.
Across all evaluation protocols, GaitNet consistently outperforms state of the art. This shows the superior of GaitNet on learning a robust representation under different variations. It is contributed to our ability to disentangle pose/gait information from other static variations.

5.2.2 USF
The original protocol of USF [37] does not deﬁne a training set, which is not applicable to our method, as well as [46], that require data to train the models. Hence following the experiment setting in [46], we randomly partition the dataset into the non-overlapping training and test sets, each with half of the subjects. We test on Probe A, deﬁned in [46], where the probe is different from the gallery by the viewpoint. We

achieve the identiﬁcation accuracy of 99.5 ± 0.2%, which is better than the reported 96.7 ± 0.5% of LB network [46], and 94.7 ± 2.2% of multi-task GAN [22].
5.2.3 FVG Given that FVG is a newly collected database and no reported performance from prior work, we make the efforts to implement 4 classic or state-of-the-art methods on gait recognition [20, 38, 1, 46]. For each of 4 methods and our GaitNet, one model is trained with the 136-subject training set and tested on all 5 protocols.
As shown in Tab. 6, our method shows state-of-the-art performance compared with other methods, including the recent CNN-based methods. Among 5 protocols, CL is the most challenging variation as in CASIA-B. Comparing with all different methods GEI based methods suffer from frontal view due to the lack of walking information.
5.3. Runtime Speed
System efﬁciency is an essential metric for many vision systems including gait recognition. We calculate the efﬁciency while each of the 5 methods processing one video of USF dataset on the same desktop with GeForce GTX 1080 Ti GPU. As shown in Tab. 7, our method is signiﬁcantly faster than the pose estimation method because of 1) efﬁciency of Mask R-CNN; 2) an accurate, yet slow, version of AlphaPose [16] is required for gait recognition.
6. Conclusions
This paper presents an autoencoder-based method termed GaitNet that can disentangle appearance and gait feature representation from raw RGB frames, and utilize a multi-layer LSTM structure to further explore temporal information to generate a gait representation for each video sequence. We compare our method extensively with the state of the arts on CASIA-B, USF, and our collected FVG datasets. The superior results show the generalization and promising of the proposed feature disentanglement approach. We hope that in the future, this disentanglement approach is a viable option for other vision problems where motion dynamics needs to be extracted while being invariant to confounding factors, e.g., expression recognition with invariance to facial appearance, activity recognition with invariance to clothing.
