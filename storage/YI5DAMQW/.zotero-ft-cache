    Abstract: Multi-object tracking is a fundamental vision problem that has been studied for a long time. As deep learning brings excellent performances to object detection algorithms, Tracking by Detection (TBD) has become the mainstream tracking framework. Despite the success of TBD, this two-step method is too complicated to train in an end-to-end manner and induces many challenges as well, such as insufficient exploration of video spatial-temporal information, vulnerability when facing object occlusion, and excessive reliance on detection results. To address these challenges, we propose a concise end-to-end model TubeTK which only needs one step training by introducing the ``bounding-tube" to indicate temporal-spatial locations of objects in a short video clip. TubeTK provides a novel direction of multi-object tracking, and we demonstrate its potential to solve the above challenges without bells and whistles. We analyze the performance of TubeTK on several MOT benchmarks and provide empirical evidence to show that TubeTK has the ability to overcome occlusions to some extent without any ancillary technologies like Re-ID. Compared with other methods that adopt private detection results, our one-stage end-to-end model achieves state-of-the-art performances even if it adopts no ready-made detection results. We hope that the proposed TubeTK model can serve as a simple but strong alternative for video-based MOT task. The code and models are available at this https URL .
