    Abstract: As an important area in computer vision, object tracking has formed two separate communities that respectively study Single Object Tracking (SOT) and Multiple Object Tracking (MOT). However, current methods in one tracking scenario are not easily adapted to the other due to the divergent training datasets and tracking objects of both tasks. Although UniTrack \cite{wang2021different} demonstrates that a shared appearance model with multiple heads can be used to tackle individual tracking tasks, it fails to exploit the large-scale tracking datasets for training and performs poorly on single object tracking. In this work, we present the Unified Transformer Tracker (UTT) to address tracking problems in different scenarios with one paradigm. A track transformer is developed in our UTT to track the target in both SOT and MOT. The correlation between the target and tracking frame features is exploited to localize the target. We demonstrate that both SOT and MOT tasks can be solved within this framework. The model can be simultaneously end-to-end trained by alternatively optimizing the SOT and MOT objectives on the datasets of individual tasks. Extensive experiments are conducted on several benchmarks with a unified model trained on SOT and MOT datasets. Code will be available at this https URL .
